You are a senior product designer and frontend architect building a professional financial analytics platform for Indian stock markets.
Improve the entire UI/UX of this application to look institutional, systematic, modern, and trustworthy, similar to platforms like Screener, Bloomberg, Capital IQ, and Yahoo Finance Pro.

1. Overall Design Language

Use a clean, professional fintech aesthetic

Prefer white / light background with subtle greys, dark text, and 1–2 accent colors only (blue/teal/indigo)

Avoid flashy colors, gradients, or playful UI

Consistent spacing, alignment, and typography across all screens

Everything should feel structured, calm, and data-first

2. Typography

Use Inter / Roboto / Source Sans Pro

Clear hierarchy:

Page title (large, bold)

Section headers (medium, semi-bold)

Labels (small, muted)

Data values (clear, readable, slightly emphasized)

Numbers and financial metrics should stand out clearly

3. Layout & Structure

Introduce a proper dashboard layout

Top navigation bar with app name and primary actions

Left sidebar (if useful) for:

Beta Calculator

Comparable Companies

Historical Beta

Settings / Methodology

Main content area should be card-based

Each logical feature must be inside its own well-defined card or section

4. Search & Inputs (Very Important)

Implement a professional stock search bar

Autocomplete / dropdown search

Show company name + ticker + exchange (NSE/BSE)

Inputs should:

Have clear labels

Show placeholder examples

Use dropdowns instead of free text wherever possible

Date selectors should be calendar-based

5. Beta Calculation UI

Clearly show:

Selected company

Index used (NIFTY 50 / SENSEX)

Time period (5Y Daily / 5Y Monthly – explicitly visible)

Display beta result in a highlighted metric card

Add a small note explaining:

Data frequency

Calculation logic (simple, non-technical)

6. Comparable Companies Section

Show comparables in a clean table

Company Name

Ticker

Sector / Industry

Beta

Key multiples (PE, PB, EV/EBITDA if available)

Allow:

Sorting

Clear alignment of numbers

Avoid random peers — UI should clearly indicate “Peer Selection Logic”

7. Visual Hierarchy & Data Presentation

Use:

Cards

Subtle borders

Light shadows (very minimal)

No clutter

No unnecessary icons

Every screen should answer:
“What is the main data here?”

8. Professional Touches

Add:

Tooltips for financial terms

Subtle loading states (skeleton loaders)

Clear empty states (“Select a company to begin”)

No emojis

No playful micro-animations

9. Consistency & Cleanliness

Ensure:

Same button styles everywhere

Same spacing system everywhere

Same table formatting everywhere

Remove anything that feels experimental, random, or unstructured

10. Final Objective

The UI should feel like a tool used by analysts, valuation professionals, and serious investors, not a demo or hobby project.

Make the UI simple, systematic, professional, and credible.
